# Instructions

Determine the fewest number of coins to give a customer so that the sum of their values equals the correct amount of change.

## Examples

- An amount of 15 with available coin values [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one coin of value 5 and one coin of value 10, or [5, 10].
- An amount of 40 with available coin values [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one coin of value 5, one coin of value 10, and one coin of value 25, or [5, 10, 25].

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when change cannot be made with the coins given. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.

To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# example when change cannot be made with the coins passed in
raise ValueError("can't make target with given coins")
```
