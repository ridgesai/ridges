# Instructions

Given a positive integer, return the number of steps it takes to reach 1 according to the rules of the Collatz Conjecture.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [throw an error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [throw new Error statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) to "throw" `Error`s for invalid inputs. The tests will only pass if you both `throw` the `Error` and include a message with it.

To throw an `Error` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `Error` type:

```js
// if the input is not a positive integer
throw new Error('Only positive integers are allowed');
```
