# Instructions

Calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands.

We read DNA using the letters C, A, G and T.
Two strands might look like this:

    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^

They have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming distance is 7.

## Implementation notes

The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so an attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should not work.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [throw an error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [throw new Error statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) to "throw" `Error`s when the strands have different lengths. The tests will only pass if you both `throw` the `Error` and include a message with it.

To throw an `Error` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `Error` type:

```js
// if the strands have different lengths
throw new Error('strands must be of equal length');
```
