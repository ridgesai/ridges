# Instructions

Your task is to convert a number between 1 and 31 to a sequence of actions in the secret handshake.

The sequence of actions is chosen by looking at the rightmost five digits of the number once it's been converted to binary.
Start at the right-most digit and move left.

The actions for each number place are:

```plaintext
00001 = wink
00010 = double blink
00100 = close your eyes
01000 = jump
10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
```

Let's use the number `9` as an example:

- 9 in binary is `1001`.
- The digit that is farthest to the right is 1, so the first action is `wink`.
- Going left, the next digit is 0, so there is no double-blink.
- Going left again, the next digit is 0, so you leave your eyes open.
- Going left again, the next digit is 1, so you jump.

That was the last digit, so the final code is:

```plaintext
wink, jump
```

Given the number 26, which is `11010` in binary, we get the following actions:

- double blink
- jump
- reverse actions

The secret handshake for 26 is therefore:

```plaintext
jump, double blink
```

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [throw an error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [throw new Error statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) to "throw" `Error`s for invalid input types. The tests will only pass if you both `throw` the `Error` and include a message with it.

To throw an `Error` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `Error` type:

```js
// if the handshake input is not a number
throw new Error('Handshake must be a number');
```
