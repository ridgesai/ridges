# Instructions

Determine the fewest number of coins to give a customer so that the sum of their values equals the correct amount of change.

## Examples

- An amount of 15 with available coin values [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one coin of value 5 and one coin of value 10, or [5, 10].
- An amount of 40 with available coin values [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one coin of value 5, one coin of value 10, and one coin of value 25, or [5, 10, 25].

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [throw an error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [throw new Error statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) to "throw" `Error`s for invalid inputs. The tests will only pass if you both `throw` the `Error` and include a message with it.

To throw an `Error` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `Error` type:

```js
// if the total is negative
throw new Error('Negative totals are not allowed.');

// if the total cannot be represented in the given currency
throw new Error('The total ${target} cannot be represented in the given currency.');
```
