# Instructions

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.

One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.
If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.

For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:

| Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mercury | 0.2408467                     |
| Venus   | 0.61519726                    |
| Earth   | 1.0                           |
| Mars    | 1.8808158                     |
| Jupiter | 11.862615                     |
| Saturn  | 29.447498                     |
| Uranus  | 84.016846                     |
| Neptune | 164.79132                     |

~~~~exercism/note
The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).
The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.
While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.
See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to [throw an error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.

This particular exercise requires that you use the [throw new Error statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) to "throw" `Error`s for invalid planet names. The tests will only pass if you both `throw` the `Error` and include a message with it.

To throw an `Error` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `Error` type:

```js
// if the planet name is not valid
throw new Error('not a planet');
```
